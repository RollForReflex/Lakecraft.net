                    The world file is freely available for download.  You can preview the world by connecting to lakecraft.net via your copy of Minecraft. Our online server will enable you to explore the Lakecraft world but will not permit you to destroy or place blocks. Once the world is downloaded, you can modify the world file on your personal computer or local server.  If you would like to share a modified world please email us a link, and we will post it on Lakecraft’s versioned world webpage, coming soon. 
                </p>
                
                <p class="warning">
                    Note: If you make major upgrades to the world, for example integrating 3-D SketchUp models of area landmarks or additional geospatial data, submit them in .world file format for possible inclusion in a future update.

                <h3>Educational Use</h3>
                <p>
                    Minecraft is a popular, multiplayer sandbox game that models the real world in a virtual environment. Employed correctly, it can be used a powerful tool for engaging students in the exploration of real world spatial data and introductory programming.  Within Minecraft, players are able to craft everyday items (houses, trees) using blocks within the game’s environment.  At a more advanced level, students can modify entire worlds and develop basic computer programming skills. Minecraft’s functionality lends itself to the teaching of various subjects, including ecology, chemistry, and physics.

                <h5>Custom Educator's Package</h5>
                <p>
                    We suggest that classroom educator’s purchase the The MinecraftEdu package rather than conventional Minecraft game licenses for use in their school.  MinecraftEdu modifies the game’s code to provide additional control features for teachers.  With MinecraftEdu, teachers can control students movements, limit players’ access to in-game materials, and easily set-up a local server for hosting Lakecraft and other world files.  MinecraftEdu also provides a training world for acquainting students unfamiliar with the game’s commands.  Visit, <a href="http://www.minecraftedu.com">MinecraftEdu</a> to purchase the package at a discount educator’s rate ($376 for 25 licenses and the MinecraftEdu Custom Mod or $18 per license + $41 for the MinecraftEdu Custom Mod).

                <h5>Getting Around</h5>
                <p>
                    The default spawn location for Lakecraft is The Burlington Waterfront.  The world’s boundaries are those of the Lake Champlain watershed, within which are parts of Vermont, New York, and Quebec.  The world does not currently provide a mechanism for geolocating your player.  However, major and secondary roads, rivers, and geographic landmarks, such as mountains and bays, can help you locate yourself within the world.  We aspire to integrate GPS navigation in a future update.
